        <h2 id=about>About</h2>
        <p>A group of experienced lawyers came together during the 2020 pandemic to publish Square One.</p>
        <p>Like others who were able to keep working during the 2020 pandemic, even as Americans lost work in record numbers, we felt a need to do what we could for those who weren’t so lucky. Part of that is helping companies who can rehire do so. Uncertainty and costs around basic legal terms shouldn’t slow them down.</p>
        <p>Of course, there’s no such thing as “perfect” legal terms. But we’ve tried our best, based on our judgment and experience, to fit as many common situations as possible, nationwide. Some forms favor companies more heavily. Some favor workers. Square One tries to be fair to both, to give folks what they expect.</p>
        <p><a href=https://notlegaladvice.law>That said, there’s no substitute for talking to a lawyer, helping them understand your business, and allowing them to tailor a set of terms specifically for your needs.</a> A tailored shirt nearly always fits better than a shirt off a rack or a shelf. But most of us aren’t wearing tailored shirts right now.</p>
