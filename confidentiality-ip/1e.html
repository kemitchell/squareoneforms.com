Copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and trademarks are the most common. When these terms say <span class="term">Intellectual Property Rights</span>, they also mean legal rights in applications to protect <span class="term">Intellectual Property Rights</span>, like copyright, trademark, and patent applications.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 id="purpose-of-intellectual-property-terms">Purpose of Intellectual Property Terms</h3><p>The purpose of <a href="#intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</a> is to make sure the company gets ownership of all <span class="term">Intellectual Property Rights</span> in your work for the company, or least very broad permission to use it. Since the legal rules about intellectual property are a bit complicated, these terms are, too. But at a high level:</p><ol><li><p>You promise to let the company know about the work you do in <a href="#disclosure">Disclosure</a>.</p></li><li><p>If the law allows the company to own your work to begin with, <a href="#work-made-for-hire">Work Made for Hire</a> makes it so.</p></li><li><p>If rights in your work unavoidably belong to you to start, you transfer them to the company in <a href="#assignment">Assignment</a>.</p></li><li><p>If you can’t transfer your rights, or use the rights of others, you license them to the company in <a href="#license">License</a>.</p></li><li><p>If you can’t transfer special “moral rights“, such as in artwork, you agree not to enforce those rights in <a href="#moral-rights">Moral Rights</a>.</p></li></ol></div><div class="section"><h3 id="covered-intellectual-property">Covered Intellectual Property</h3><div class="section"><h4 id="general-definition">General Definition</h4><p><span class="definition">New Intellectual Property</span> means all intellectual property in these kinds of work, created by you alone or with others:</p><ol><li><p>work you did before starting work with the company, as a head start on work for the company</p></li><li><p>work you do for the company</p></li><li><p>work you create using equipment, supplies, facilities, or confidential information from the company</p></li><li><p>any work building on any of this kind of work</p></li></ol></div><div class="section"><h4 id="state-law-exclusions">State Law Exclusions</h4><p>If you live in a state with laws that limit the intellectual property rights that terms like these can assign to the company, <span class="term">New Intellectual Property</span> does not include any rights that can’t legally be assigned under that law. Examples of those state laws include:</p><ol><li><p>California Labor Code section 2870</p></li><li><p>Delaware Code Annotated title 19 section 805</p></li><li><p>Illinois Compiled Statutes section 1060/2</p></li><li><p>Kansas Labor and Industries Code section 44-130</p></li><li><p>Minnesota Labor, Industry Code section 181.78</p></li><li><p>New Jersey Statutes section 34:1B-265</p></li><li><p>North Carolina General Statutes chapter 66 article 10 sections 66-57.1 and 66-57.2</p></li><li><p>Utah Code Annotated sections title 34 chapter 39</p></li><li><p>Washington Revised Code sections 49.44.140 and 49.44.150</p></li><li><p>any similar law in your state</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h3><p>You agree to keep records of the work create for the company, and to promptly disclose <span class="term">New Intellectual Property</span> covered by these terms to the company in writing, as it is created. If you’re not sure whether you’ve created <span class="term">New Intellectual Property</span>, you agree to disclose your work to the company anyway, so the company can decide.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 id="work-made-for-hire">Work Made for Hire</h3><div class="section"><h4 id="express-agreement-to-make-work-made-for-hire">Express Agreement to Make “Work Made for Hire”</h4><p>Subject to <a href="#state-employment-law-exception">State Employment Law Exception</a>, as far as the law allows, <span class="term">New Intellectual Property</span> will be “work made for hire” under copyright law.</p></div><div class="section"><h4 id="state-employment-law-exception">State Employment Law Exception</h4><p>Some states have laws that make workers who agree to make “work made for hire” into employees, even if they would otherwise be contractors. For example, section 3351.5(c) of the California Labor Code and section 686 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code. If you live in one of those states and work for the company as a contractor, <a href="#express-agreement-to-make-work-made-for-hire">Express Agreement to Make “Work Made for Hire”</a> does not apply if it would make you an employee under your state’s law.</p></div></div><div class="section"><h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3><div class="section"><h4 id="assignment-of-rights">Assignment of Rights</h4><p>You assign all your rights in <span class="term">New Intellectual Property</span> that aren’t covered by <a href="#work-made-for-hire">Work Made for Hire</a> to the company.</p></div><div class="section"><h4 id="further-steps">Further Steps</h4><p>You agree to do everything necessary to paper assignments in <a href="#assignment">Assignment</a>, make them legally effective, and help the company enforce the rights assigned.

That license allows the company to do anything that would otherwise infringe <span class="term">Intellectual Property Rights</span>, and to sublicense others to do so. The license isn’t limited in time or otherwise, and you may not take it back.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 id="moral-rights">Moral Rights</h3><p>If the law gives you “moral rights” in work for the company that you can’t assign, you waive those rights and promise not to enforce them against anyone.</p></div></div><div class="section"><h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2><p>You guarantee that:</p><ol><li><p>agreeing to these terms and following them won’t cause you to break any other agreement with anyone else</p></li><li><p>you will not use or build on <span class="term">Intellectual Property Rights</span> that you can’t license to the company under <a href="#license">License</a> in work for the company</p></li><li><p>you will not infringe the <span class="term">Intellectual Property Rights</span> of others in work for the company</p></li></ol></div><div class="section"><h2 id="general-contract-terms">General Contract Terms</h2><div class="section"><h3 id="law">Law</h3><p>If the company employs you, the law of the state where you work will govern all rights and duties under these terms. If the company hires you as a contractor, the same law that governs your contract governs these terms.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 id="disputes">Disputes</h3><p>If the company employs you, we agree to make any legal claims related to these terms only in the federal or state courts nearest the address that the company provides with its signature. If the company hires you as a contractor, we agree to follow the dispute-resolution terms of your contract for legal claims related to these terms.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 id="whole-agreement">Whole Agreement</h3><p>These terms and any document incorporating them by reference list all the terms you and the company agree to about confidentiality and intellectual property in your work for the company.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 id="no-assignment">No Assignment</h3><p>You may not assign our agreement without written permission from the company. The company can assign our agreement, as a whole, to another business entity that acquires its stock or substantially all its assets, or to a new business entity set up to change its legal for or jurisdiction. Any attempt to assign rights under our agreement against these terms has no legal effect.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 id="no-delegation">No Delegation</h3><p>Neither side may delegate any duty under our agreement. Any attempt to delegate has no legal effect.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 id="unenforceable-terms">Unenforceable Terms</h3><p>If a court decides that any part of these terms can’t be enforced, for any reason, the rest of these terms will continue to apply.</p></div></div></div>
